# Course plan for CS315 Fall 2024

## Development

There's a nice plug-in for VSCode called Live Server
that makes it easy to spin up a web server and test that
the pages are working right.

## Build and deploy

There is no build step. Run `make deploy` after mounting csweb
to copy the `src` directory to the right location.
